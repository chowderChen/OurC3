    what this part do is weird
    should i change the type of id? propably not
    why casting both value and id value???
        value will be return, 

fixed:
PP MM value priority problem

fixed:
operation with constant: type will be the larger type( int < float )
operation with identifier: ?
value of expresion about '=' should be the value after casting to identifier

done:
array not implement yet

relation between lexer, parser, evaler: current state seems ok

mTokenString duplicate:
    pointer or reference or pass by parameter?

done:
line 1153 need fix: get/set entire array or one element?

cout << ( a3 = a1 = a2++ + -a3*3/2 ) << "\n" ;
a1: 15->-77
a2: -25->-24
a3: 35->-77

cout << a1-305%a2 << "\n" ; -> -94
